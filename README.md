# White-Wine-Analysis-with-R
Udacity Project - Exploratory Data Analysis using R

This project explored a dataset of white wines and some basic features, including wine ratings and chemical content.   Using R, I explored which features had greater impact on quality ratings, and attempted to build a predictive model using those features.
